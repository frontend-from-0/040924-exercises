Tasks:
1. When a user clicks on the text of the todo item, only the text should be crossed (add line-through text decoration)
2. A user should only be able to add an actual todo item to the list (do not allow adding an empty string or similar)
3. When the page is reloaded, check the to-do items saved in the local storage and add them to the list. For any newly added list item, make sure to update values in local storage accordingly
4. When removing a todo from the list, remove it from the local storage as well
5. Style the application, and make sure it is accessible and responsive.
