## Tasks to complete:

- By default, the slides should change automatically every 3 seconds. There's a built in function for it in JS.

- Add a start / stop button (e.g. center of the image). It should start / stop auto change of slides.

- When user clicks on an indicator, the corresponding image should be shown (e.g. if clicked on the second indicator, second image should be shown, if on 3rd, 3rd image should be shown).

- Make sure to clean up code an move repeated parts into separate function(s).
