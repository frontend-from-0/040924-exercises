## 🎯 Fixing Code Formatting

To make sure your code looks clean and consistent:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Go to the **root folder** of the project.
3. Run this command:

```

## 💾 Save and Commit Your Changes

After formatting is done:

1. Add all the changed files to Git:

```
git add .
```

2. Make a commit with a short message:

```
git commit -m "Format code"
```

3. (Optional) Push your changes to GitHub:

```
git push
```

Alternatively, you can use interface in the VSCode to stage and commit modified files.
